# Mister Cocktail

This was the second rails app I built. It was part of [Le Wagon](http://www.lewagon.com)'s immersive coding program's curriculum.

It is still a very basic app but it introduces more complex relations between models (compared to [La Cuillere](https://github.com/nozbzh/lacuillere)) and adds image upload through Amazon S3. It allows you to create a cocktail and add a photo to it. You can choose ingredients from a dropdown list that you add to the cocktail. For each ingredient you add, you need to select a dose. You can also delete ingredients straight from the 'show' view of a cocktail.
