# Mister Cocktail

This was the second rails app I built during [Le Wagon](www.lewagon.com)'s immersive fullstack web development program in June 2015.

It is still a very basic app but it introduces more complex relations between models (compared to [La Cuillere](https://github.com/nozbzh/lacuillere)) and adds image upload through Amazon S3. It allows you to create a cocktail and add a photo to it. You can choose ingredients from a dropdown list that you add to the cocktail. For each ingredient you add, you need to select a dose. You can also delete ingredients straight from the 'show' view of a cocktail.

This was the first app I deployed. You can find it [here](https://nozbzh-mister-cocktail.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.
